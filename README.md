# Introduction:

 This project will atempt to give an analisis of songs from Spotify using a  library that implements the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) into python called [Spotipy](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy). Using this information, we will try to build a playlist of the trends per country per day and then try to implement other features.


# Implementation:
The implementation can be found in the [spotify.py](https://github.com/theDeadIns/zombie/blob/master/spotify.py) file above

 # Testing Results:

 So far, we have managed to obtain as many as 20 songs per execution in json format however, we still need to determine the frecuency in witch we are going to be running the scrpit, given that the trends do not change that frecuently (we are still testing this).

 # Resources:
## Data stream:
- Spotify
## Data processing:
- Python
- Pandas
- Bokeh

## Data storage:
- json files
- MySQL
